         <p class="font1">Mumbai-based Baro Design specialises in handcrafted furniture and lighting. Spearheaded by
              Siddharth Sirohi, an award-winning designer who also co-founded the lifestyle store Baro, Baro Design
               plays with a modern palate while staying true to old wood and time-honoured craft techniques. Baro
                Design's furniture is made from reclaimed teak, for its age and quality as well as to keep our 
                world sustainable. The wood is brought to life using layers of linseed oil and beeswax.</p>
                
         <p class="font1">“Our philosophy at Baro Design is to inspire in each one of us the desire to be fully aware 
             and engaged with the present moment. We seek to create a realm wherein each object that surrounds 
             you distils in you a desire to ‘live in the now’,” says Sirohi. It is with this thought process that 
             he made a career shift from production design in films to creating furniture. </p>
         <p class="font1">As a yoga practitioner himself, Sirohi’s designs often reflect his understanding of 
             human body. “Recently, I designed a day bed for a client who hates the idea of working on a desk at 
             home, so he wanted to lounge and work. We created a piece that allowed him to sit in the
              Dandasana posture – straight legs and erect back but while leaning slightly. At Baro, we work 
              towards creating a design solution based on what will work best for you and your lifestyle.”</p>

            <p class="font1">When it comes to design, Sirohi’s endeavour is to create furniture that is drool-worthy.
                 Inspired by mid-century and Japanese design, his line of furniture is based on diligence, precision 
                 and equally important, sustainability. Each piece is crafted using well-seasoned, reclaimed teakwood,
                  which means that the wood was previously a door, a bed or even a pillar. This process reduces the burden 
                  on the environment and further supports the local community with the employment of local artisans who use
                   traditional wood joinery methods. The construction and design are contemporary while the upholstery are 
                   colourful and reflect an Indian ethos. This homegrown furniture label is definitely one that’s custom-made for you.
